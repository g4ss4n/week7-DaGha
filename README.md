# Simple Registration APP

Currently not working! try running it locally.
This app is about personality tests, means
We can guess your character according to your choices in our test!

### How to use

First you have to register - by clicking on REGISTER and filling the forum :)

Then you will have to answer some questions and and you will see the table of each users with his/her results!

In case it registers with hashed password you can try this username - g4ss4n, password -123456 (still could not add the cookie and the password matching method ...)

### Workflow

1.  First we came up with the idea of what the website should be about.
2.  We designed the the front-end using html, css and javascript!
3.  We created the server and the router (also the handler)
4.  we created the database (check the diagram below) and hosted it on Heruko.
5.  we created the post functions that adds the data to your database
6.  applied jws hash method to postData function

### Database Diagram

We have two tables here

- users
- results

As you can see it has one to one relationship.
